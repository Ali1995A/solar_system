A single-file, interactive 3D solar system built with Three.js and vanilla JavaScript. It renders all eight planets with logarithmic orbital scaling, a glowing sun, Saturn's rings, Earth's moon, and a modern UI overlay.

## Features

- 8 planets with relative size scale and log-scaled orbital distances
- Sun glow with emissive material + point light
- Planet axial tilt, rotation, and orbit animation
- Saturn rings and Earth moon
- Click to open a planet info card
- Time speed slider and pause/play
- Camera focus selector + OrbitControls

## Run

Just open `index.html` in a modern browser (Chrome, Edge, Safari).

## Controls
